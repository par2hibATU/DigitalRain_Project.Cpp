## Introduction
This project is a console-based C++ application that uses a stream of Unicode letters to create the illusion of a visually dynamic rain-like motion. This project effectively utilizes contemporary C++ technologies and Windows API while showcasing fine control over console rendering real-time user interaction, and structured object-oriented architecture.

A well defined character set, stated as a **constexpr static wchar_t** array, is at the heart of the system. This approach ensures that the character data is:
 -  Reduced runtime overhead through evaluation at compile time  
 - Unchangeable, guaranteeing consistency and guarding against unintentional alteration  
 - Effective since the symbol pool is quickly accessed during animation rendering and kept in read-only memory.

The **wchar_t** type is used to support a wide range of wide Unicode characters, giving the rain effect a rich and diverse appearance by combining digits, Latin letters, Greek letters, phonetic symbols, and space padding for realism.

The animation is structured around two main components:

 - **Raindrop Class**: Shows a single stream that is falling. Position,
   length, and a std::vector with randomized symbols are all stored by
   each Raindrop instance. Using SetConsoleTextAttribute, it manages its
   own rendering (draw) and movement (update) with dynamically selected
   green hues for visual appeal and variation.

 - **MatrixRain class**: Multiple Raindrop objects are initialized, frame-by-frame rendering is managed, user input is handled (such as stopping, quitting, and speed adjustments), and the main animation loop is maintained. Real-time responsiveness is made possible by controlling the simulation pace with std::this_thread::sleep_for.

_kbhit() and _getch() from **conio.h** are used to detect user inputs non-blocking, providing smooth control without breaking the animation flow.


Additional Features:

 - **Real-time control**: Press Q to stop, P to pause or continue, and + or - to increase or decrease the speed.

 - **Randomized stream behaviour**: To produce a natural, flowing effect, raindrops have varying initial positions, lengths, and symbol orders.

 - **Console utility tools**: The ConsoleUtils namespace contains functions like hideCursor() and setCursorPosition() that handle low-level visual control, enhancing user experience and preserving a tidy user interface.

This project is intended to be readable, extensible and modular. Future extensions (such as colour schemes, gradients, effects) are easy to implement thanks to its application of object-oriented principles.
In conclusion, this project showcases responsive input handling, low-level console manipulation, effective Unicode rendering, and careful use of compile-time constantsâ€”all combined into a fluid and engaging C++ terminal animation.
